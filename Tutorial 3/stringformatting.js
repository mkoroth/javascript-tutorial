// LESSON: string formatting

// 1st way of formatting strings
// const age = 10
// const string = "hello, there. i am " + age + " years old"
// console.log(string) // hello, there. i am 10 years old

// 2nd way of formatting strings
/* const name = 'api'
const age = 29
const string = `hello there my name is ${name}. I am ${age} years old`
console.log(string) */

// TODO: write some mad libs so that when the variable changes, the sentence becomes different. this has to be one string and you have to print it

const noun1 = "matress"
const noun2 = "door"
const noun3 = "head"

const verb = "eating"

const place = "mcdonalds"

const story = `hello this ${noun1} belong to my friend named ${noun2}. he drives a big ${noun3} which keeps ${verb} and stops at places like ${place}` 
console.log(story)
