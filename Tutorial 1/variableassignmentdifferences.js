// LESSON: differences between var and let

// var camper = "James"
// var camper = "David"
// console.log(camper) // this will print David

// no errors happen for the above code which makes finding errors hard
// a major update called es6 came out and introduced the keyword 'let'. This fixes the issue

// let camper = "James"
// let camper = "David" // this causes issue that you cant create the same variable called campler

// TOOD: create a variable called my first name in javascript and make sure to use the let keyword


let myFirstName = "Mithun"
console.log(myFirstName)
