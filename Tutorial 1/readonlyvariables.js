// LESSON: READ ONLY VARIABLES

/*
 using var and let when declaring variables are okay.
 let is better than var because it lets you make sure you don't reassign an already existing variable.
 Another problem that can happen is if you want a variable to never changes.
 For example. your name won't change. You can use the keyword 'const' to declare a variable that won't change
*/

// declaring a fixed variable
const name = "mithun"

// if you try reassigning this variable, all sorts or problems occur
name = "mithunn"


// normally we name our constants with all caps
const NAME = "mithun"


// TODO: create a variable called last name and make sure this variable is fixed always
const LAST_NAME = "Mithun"
